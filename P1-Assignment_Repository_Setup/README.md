# Overview

This app (name pending) is a productivity and habit app designed to help people with nuerodivergencies to organize their time and tasks in a way that emphazies a positive exeperience and is customizable to an individuals needs. The app will have a pomodoro section that allows the user to regulate periods of focus and rest to both help them keep on task and prevent them from becoming overly hyperfocuses on a task. It will also have a customizable to-do list with the option to load pre-saved task sets that will keep track of what the user needs to do in a certain time frame and give reminders if too much time has passed since the task was set. 

In order to keep the experience positive and rewarding the app will also award the user with an in-app currency called "pumpkins" for completing tasks. The user can set the ammount of pumpkins a task is worth as well as create custom rewards to spend their pumpkins on such as watching an episode of TV or eating a cookie. In addition to this the user can also spend their pumpkins to care for a virtual pet that needs to be watered and fed in order to keep its happiness up. This will encourage the user to keep using the app to mark their tasks and motivate them to tackle things they may otherwise procrastinate on. 

## Features
1. A pomodoro timer
2. A to-do list that gives the user pumpkins when tasks are completed.
3. A virtual animal to care for with pumpkins. 
4. A rewards store where the user can spend pumpkins on custom rewards.
5. User profile that stores a users custom lists and rewards.


## Technologies:

This app will use Javascript, HTML, and CSS to display the website and style pages. Java and MySQL possibly to handle the parts that require saving user profile information. 

## What Iâ€™ll have to learn:

Flash no longer exists so we have to find an alternative for the pet minigame. I will also have to get much better at Javascript so I can help out on the front end as this will likely be a front end heavy project. I haven't branched much further out from what LC101 has covered so building something from the ground up will require me to learn how to use front end and back end together.
